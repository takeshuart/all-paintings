The sniffing of the wind when a digger looks up, say, or speaking. Life, in short.’</p>\n                ",

        "intro": "\n                    <h4>Increased skills</h4>\n<p>Figure drawing is not easy for Van Gogh. After a year of concentrated practice, he now decides to also make figure studies in oils. He takes his field easel, canvas and paintbox to Scheveningen, where he paints this fisherman. His increased skills and self-confidence are apparent in, among other things, the fact that he no longer makes an underdrawing, but lays out the representation directly with the brush.</p>\n<h4>‘Define the form’</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh paints the beach and the sea in flowing movements with a fairly large brush, and the figure with a slightly narrower brush. His main challenge is to place the various colours in such a way that they ‘define the form’. He avoids overly complicated details, such as hands and faces: for him, the ‘effect’ is of primary importance.</p>\n<h4>Model</h4>\n<p>With his large head and short body, the fisherman looks more like a ‘fisher boy’ than an adult. Van Gogh may have used a young model here, because shortly before making this study, he writes to Theo: ‘I have a model – a country lad – who lives here in the neighbourhood and to whom I’ve already spoken about painting studies’.</p>\n                ",

He is more interested in the people who work the land than the animals they rear to pull their machinery. He very rarely makes them the independent subject of study, as in this depiction of a red and white ox hitched in front of a cart.</p>\n<h4>Displaced impression</h4>\n<p>When Van Gogh develops a motif, he takes his cues from what he sees in his immediate surroundings, but also from the examples of painters he admires. In this work, he refers to <em>Oxcart on a country road</em> by Anton Mauve. But unlike Mauve’s ox, without a natural background this animal makes a somewhat displaced impression. Van Gogh probably regards this yoked animal primarily as an important attribute of the peasant, even though he omits the figure himself.</p>\n<h4>Reddish brown tones</h4>\n<p>The animal’s boniness and coloured hide offer him the opportunity to experiment with light-dark contrasts and to vary the reddish brown tones. Together with this work, he also makes a study of a black ox in a mirrored composition. In contrast to the red and white ox, Van Gogh places its counterpart in the countryside surrounded by birds.</p>\n                ",

In this study he concentrates mainly on the representation of the figure and his clothing. The light on the shoulder and arm creates a contrast between the blue-green colour of the rough fabric of the overalls and the dark red of the digger’s face and hand.</p>\n<h4>Great desire</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh is aware that his depiction of the figure is not ‘correct in proportion and anatomy’, like the academic painters. Nor does he aspire to that. His ‘great desire is to learn to make such inaccuracies, such variations, reworkings, alterations of the reality, that it might become, very well – lies if you will – but – truer than the literal truth’.</p>\n<h4>Essentially modern</h4>\n<p>He wants to show the ‘figure of the peasant in action’: ‘this peasant has to be a peasant, this digger has to dig’. For him, this is characteristic for the depiction of a figure and ‘essentially modern’. ‘The figure of the peasant and the workman started more as a “genre” – but nowadays, with Millet in the vanguard as the eternal master, it’s the very heart of modern art and will remain so.’</p>\n                ",

This is when he reads in a book by the French art theorist Charles Blanc about ‘the law of simultaneous contrast’: colours may reinforce or, conversely, diminish each other, depending on the combinations in which they are applied.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Colour experiments</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh begins his own colour experiments and discovers that he does indeed want to work from nature, but not necessarily using the exact natural colours. When he paints trees with yellow leaves in an autumn landscape, it doesn’t matter if his yellow is not the same as the yellow of the leaves.</p>\n<h4>Insight</h4>\n<p>What it comes down to is ‘my sense of the infinite variety of tones in the same family’. He visualizes this insight in this <em>Autumn landscape</em>; a symphony in orange-brown of a few trees behind the garden of his parental home in Nuenen. Delighted, he writes to Theo: ‘The laws of colour are inexpressibly splendid precisely because they are not coincidences’.</p>\n                ",

Their painting technique and use of colour make a deep impression on him and he starts experimenting with colour and a looser brushstroke.</p>\n<h4>Influence of the impressionists</h4>\n<p><em>Recumbent nude</em> is one of the first ‘studies’ he then painted. The influence of the impressionists is already immediately visible. The bright colours in particular are in sharp contrast to the darker works that he made in the Netherlands, such as <em>The potato eaters</em>. The recumbent nude is not exactly an idealized beauty. She is painted rather roughly, her face in particular is barely developed beyond a sketch.</p>\n<h4>Agostina Segatori</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh presumably made three other, similar nudes in quick succession: a pencil drawing and two paintings. The same model appears to have posed in all the works. This is probably Agostina Segatori, owner of the café Le Tambourin on the Boulevard du Clichy, with whom Van Gogh had a brief relationship.</p>\n                ",

        "intro": "\n                    <h4>Desperation</h4>\n<p>In early August 1883, Van Gogh writes that ‘a very heavy burden’ has fallen from his shoulders. A year earlier he just wasn’t able to paint a good figure study and it had driven him to ‘desperation’. At that time he still worked in ‘the dry manner’: ‘drawing first and then filling in the outline’. Now he knows how to approach it: first place the colours next to each other correctly and only then worry about the drawing.</p>\n<h4>‘Define the form’</h4>\n<p>In this study, Van Gogh manages to model his figure quite convincingly, even though the anatomical proportions still seem a little clumsy. He paints the beach and the sea in flowing movements with a fairly large brush, and the figure with a slightly narrower brush. His main challenge is to place the various colours in such a way that they ‘define the form’. He avoids overly complicated details, such as hands and faces: for him, the ‘effect’ is of primary importance.</p>\n<h4>Sien</h4>\n<p>Against the predominantly dark grey-green and brown background, the woman’s red cape and white cap create a modest colour and tonal effect. It is quite possible that the woman he lived with at the time, Sien Hoornik, served as the model for <em>Fisherman’s wife</em>.</p>\n                ",

In July and August 1885, he documents the wheat harvest: the reaping, binding the sheaves, the gleaning and haymaking. Later in Arles and Saint-Rémy, the golden yellow wheat continues to inspire him; he paints dozens of works on the theme of wheat fields or sheaves.</p>\n<h4>Striking composition</h4>\n<p><em>Sheaves of wheat</em> occupies a special place in the oeuvre of Van Gogh due to the striking composition: an emphatically central ‘solitary’ bundle of sheaves. In other works that depict sheaves of wheat, they stand in a row or even several rows of sheaves, often accompanied by a figure binding the sheaves.</p>\n<h4>Texture and brushwork</h4>\n<p>In this painted study, Van Gogh seems to focus on practicing texture and brushwork. He depicts the mown wheat field in the foreground with sturdy brushstrokes, while the thin stalks of the bundled wheat sheaves, which are placed in the centre of the picture, are painted very finely with a thin brush. In the background, the wheat is still waiting to be harvested.</p>\n                ",

In early August 1885, he sends his duplicate nests to his friend Anthon van Rappard: ‘I thought you might like the birds’ nests as I do, because the birds – like the wren or golden oriole – can also truly be counted among the artists. At the same time they’re good for still lifes’.</p>\n<h4>Tonal study</h4>\n<p>Almost two months later, he actually starts working on this theme. During that period, he writes to his brother that he ‘feel[s] for the brood and the nests – particularly those human nests, those cottages on the heath and their inhabitants’, and that with some painters ‘all reality is at the same time symbolic’. Nevertheless, for him this still life is primarily a tonal study.</p>\n<h4>Three nests</h4>\n<p>The nest on the left is probably that of a wren, the small round nest in the middle may belong to a small songbird, such as a finch or a goldfinch. The nest on the right with the eggs could be from a song thrush or a golden oriole. The oriole builds its nest in this way at the end of a branch. The size of the eggs is also appropriate for these birds.</p>\n                ",

This is an unconventional choice of motif. He writes to his brother Theo: ‘I think that some people who know nature well might like them because of the colours of the moss, dry leaves and grasses, clay &amp;c’.</p>\n<h4>Collection</h4>\n<p>He has a collection of nests from no fewer than thirty different birds. He keeps these together with a variety of mosses, stuffed birds and other objects in two large cupboards. These are items he has collected on hiking trips over the years. He also asks boys from the neighbourhood to find birds’ nests for him, which he pays an average of 10 cents per nest for, but sometimes more for more unusual specimens, such that of the golden oriole.</p>\n<h4>Neutral background</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh deliberately paints the nests on a neutral black background to emphasize the fact that they have been removed from their natural environment. The tall, pear-shaped nest on the left and the small nest on the right may be unfinished nests of the Eurasian penduline tit. The nest in the middle belongs to a barn swallow, recognizable by its crescent shape.</p>\n                ",

Van Gogh successfully captures that colour and sheen in this still life. However, it does not date from his Dutch, but his French period. This is apparent from his use of colour, such as the bright yellow for the fish and the blue for the drapery in the background.</p>\n<h4>Impasto brushstrokes</h4>\n<p>With this work, Van Gogh continues down the path he embarked upon in 1885 to transition from his ‘tonal’ painting in earthy colours to a palette with brighter, primary colours. The brushstrokes are also far more impasto than in his previous periods and are reminiscent of the thick paint layers of Alphonse Monticelli, a Provençale painter whom he admires greatly.</p>\n                ",

They share a love for neo-impressionism and Japanese prints and become friends. This is also apparent from the dedication to his ‘friend Lucien’ in this still life; the only occasion in his Parisian period that he dedicates a work to an artist from his own time.</p>\n<h4>Faded</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh uses a light background, probably a white tablecloth, onto which the basket casts a light blue shadow. This creates a subtle contrast with the yellow, green and red tones of the sharply defined apples. The purple, blue and pink colours in the painting have faded slightly, which can be seen along the edge of the canvas where the paint was covered by the frame. The yellow may have been brighter and greener, and the basket may also have been darker.</p>\n<h4>Wall</h4>\n<p>Behind the table, a wall is painted in the same colour nuances but with vertical brushstrokes. That is exceptional for Van Gogh. He generally places his still lifes against a flat background and surface. Because of this, his still lifes often seem to be floating. That effect can also be seen here, but is more the result of the brushstrokes on the table, which follow the contours of the basket.</p>\n                ",

He also becomes interested in Japanese art and starts collecting Japanese prints together with his brother Theo.</p>\n<h4>Japanese prints</h4>\n<p>These developments are reflected in <em>Patch of grass</em>. For this, Van Gogh chooses a close-up of a field of grass, a composition that also occurs frequently in Japanese prints. He zooms in on each individual blade of grass and flower and paints them very detailed and with great refinement in a light and colourful palette.</p>\n<h4>Rapid and radical</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh reuses a canvas that he’d already painted some two and a half years earlier in Nuenen: x-ray photos reveal the head of a woman with a cap under <em>Patch of grass</em>. The strong contrast between the sombre use of colour in his Nuenen period and his colourful and light palette in Paris is remarkable.

A portrait must also express something of the subject’s emotional state. The colours are still fairly subdued in this self-portrait. Soft blue and green tints dominate the painting.

When he feels well enough and has permission to paint outside the grounds, he often visits the olive groves in the area. ‘There are very beautiful fields of olive trees here, which are grey and silvery in leaf like pollard willows. Then I never tire of the blue sky’, he writes to his mother.</p>\n<h4>Palpable</h4>\n<p>In this nature study, Van Gogh uses long brushstrokes for the tree trunks, branches and contours. For the majority of the rest of the painting – the ground, the leaves of the olive trees and the sky – he works with short, curved brushstrokes. This makes the air appear to vibrate and the heat in the olive grove almost palpable.

Instead, he makes ‘a series of colour studies in painting simply flowers’. According to his brother Theo, he receives ‘a beautiful package of flowers every week’ from acquaintances to serve as a model.</p>\n<h4>Colour theory</h4>\n<p>In these colour studies, Van Gogh seeks to apply his colour theory. This theory is largely derived from Charles Blanc. Blanc advocated for the use of complementary contrasts, that is, contrasts between the primary colours, red, yellow, and blue, and the opposing secondary colours, green, purple, and orange, on a colour scale.</p>\n<h4>Red and green</h4>\n<p>In this still life, the contrast of the complementary colours red and green is predominant. However, the red of the flowers has faded significantly over the years. In contrast to the impressionists, Van Gogh applies the paint in a heavy impasto. He takes inspiration for this from the Provençal painter Adolphe Monticelli, whom he greatly admires.</p>\n                ",

Prior to starting the painting, he makes over a hundred portrait studies of farmworkers, various drawings and two painted studies. Thus he prepares himself for his first large painting on the theme of peasant life in Brabant, which he regards as a kind of test of his mastery. He wants to prove that he is on his way to becoming an accomplished figure painter. This painting precedes the final version and has virtually the same composition, but the layout is sketchier.</p>\n<h4>Arduous peasant life</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh makes the drawings and studies at the home of the peasant family De Groot-van Rooij. It is not his intention to make precise portraits of these people. He seeks to depict the atmosphere and the primitive nature of the arduous peasant life.</p>\n<h4>'Honestly earned'</h4>\n<p>He later writes to Theo: You see, I really have wanted to make it so that people get the idea that these folk, who are eating their potatoes by the light of their little lamp, have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish, and (…) that they have thus honestly earned their food’.</p>\n<p><a class=\"c-button c-button--arrow\" href=\"https://tickets.krollermuller.nl/en/tickets\">Plan your visit</a></p>\n                ",

He chooses ‘a practical palette with healthy colours’ that he doesn’t have to mix himself. He also purchases a perspective frame that can be set up on uneven ground. One of the first paintings he subsequently makes is <em>Girl in a wood</em>.</p>\n<h4>&nbsp;‘Air’ into the composition</h4>\n<p>He selects browns, yellows and greens from his ‘practical palette’, and uses the perspective frame to correctly depict the narrowing of the tree-trunks towards the background and the distances between them, so that ‘air’ is introduced into the composition. He explains to Theo that he thereby aims to ensure ‘that one can breathe and wander about in it – and smell the woods’<img class=\"img-full\" src=\"/media/collectionitempage/blad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"757\" height=\"336\"></p>\n<h4>On his knees</h4>\n<p>He most likely painted it on his knees. This is apparent from the low perspective, but research has also found that pieces of oak leaves from the forest floor have become lodged in the wet paint at the bottom of the painting.</p>\n<h6>Images: detail of one of the 3 leaves / the spot where the leaf was found in the painting</h6>\n                ",

Moreover, he can now paint more easily from a somewhat higher vantage point, as can be seen in Edge of a wood. It is the first painting that Helene Kröller-Müller acquires of the painter she so admires.</p>\n<h4>Ordinary piece of cloth</h4>\n<p><em>Edge of a wood</em> is painted on a fairly fine canvas, possibly an ordinary piece of cloth. At the beginning of September, Van Gogh writes to his brother Theo: ‘I bought a piece of cloth recently to make some study linen for myself, and now I’ve given it to her for vests’. By ‘her’ he refers to Sien Hoornik, with whom he is currently living. Perhaps he didn’t give Sien the whole piece and has already used a part to paint on.</p>\n<h4>Alteration</h4>\n<p>In the initial layout, the path meanders between the trees on the left and the trunk of a second tree stands in the foreground on the left. Van Gogh then decides to remove this tree and straighten a section of the path. This makes the composition look more peaceful. Van Gogh is mainly concerned with the atmosphere; he believes that a landscape ‘expresses that moment and that place in nature where one can go alone, without company’.</p>\n                ",

Van Gogh cannot share his enthusiasm: ‘And at the same time (…) it’s perhaps not superfluous to point out how one of the most beautiful things by the painters of this century has been the painting of darkness that is still colour’.</p>\n<h4>Exercise</h4>\n<p>This <em>Head of a woman</em> could be an exercise in painting ‘darkness that is still colour’. The contours of the face are heavily applied; Prussian blue is incorporated in the dark lines. The skin is painted in various shades of brown. For the jacket and cap, Van Gogh chooses green and brown. He uses pink to accentuate the woman’s ear and chin.</p>\n<h4>Laid out quickly</h4>\n<p>The forms are rather flat, lacking depth. Some areas of shadow under the cheekbone and the long straight part of the neck are heavily painted. The neck is relatively too light in colour and set too far back, making the woman’s head protrude forward. Van Gogh probably laid out this head quickly and did not elaborate it for long, so as not to ‘rework’ the canvas.</p>\n                ",

In the section ‘Heads of the People’, this English illustrated magazine publishes a series of characteristic portraits of workers, which appeal to him greatly. Once in Nuenen, he seeks to capture the peasants and weavers in his own ‘Heads of the People’.</p>\n<h4>Brown and green tones</h4>\n<p>He paints this head of a woman wet-on-wet, with broad impasto brushstrokes on a cream-coloured ground layer. The rest of the work is painted remarkably smoothly, by Van Gogh’s standards. For the face and hat, he uses more or less the same warm earth tones. These form a nice contrast with the various shades of green in the background and the shawl.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Characteristic head</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh has only partially elaborated the woman’s face. Her right eye is barely visible, only a curve in the paint can be seen in relief. The highlight in the left eye gives her something of a deathly, staring expression.

In <em>Loom with weaver</em>, he also attempts to depict such an evening effect. The weaver leans forward to lay the warp threads correctly.

He fashions the wrinkles of her face in paint, as it were, and uses various shades of green for the background, hat and shawl. By so doing, he tries to give form and depth to her face. The sharp shadow lines along the nose and in the left corner of the mouth give the head its lifelike appearance.</p>\n<h4>Problems</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh’s interaction with the models causes irritation among the ‘reverend gentlemen of the priesthood’. They inform him that he ‘shouldn’t be too familiar’ with ‘people of lower station’. Meanwhile they warn the peasants ‘with threats’ that they should not allow themselves to be painted by him.

The ‘subjects’ he chooses are ‘Planting potatoes / Ox-plough / Wheat harvest / Sower / Shepherd (storm effect) / Wood gatherers (snow effect)’.

However, Van Gogh does not really manage to combine the figures into a whole.</p>\n<h4>Disappeared</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh and Hermans agree that the works will remain in Van Gogh’s possession.

He moves in with his brother Theo. Their small apartment lies at the foot of the ‘butte’ Montmartre on the northern edge of the city. At that time, this hill is still almost without buildings and has a rural character.</p>\n<h4>Cautiously experimenting</h4>\n<p>In the spring, Van Gogh explores his surroundings. He paints this panoramic <em>La butte Montmartre</em>, viewed from the north, in the open air. His sober, autumnal palette of predominantly red-brown and brown-yellow is still reminiscent of his Dutch period. But in the picturesque use of different shades of green, blue and white, he is already cautiously experimenting with colour and light.</p>\n<h4>Retouch</h4>\n<p>The almost square brushstroke slightly right of centre in the sky is a retouch, which Van Gogh himself applied. This was because a hole had formed in the paint layer, making the ground layer visible. The brushstrokes around it may have served to somewhat camouflage this all-too-visible correction.</p>\n                ",

He devotes about twenty paintings and drawings to them.</p>\n<h4>Picturesque</h4>\n<p>Pierre-Auguste Renoir immortalizes the same location as a place for celebration and enjoyment in his <em>Le Moulin de la Galette</em>; Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec as a place for sometimes less than respectable rendezvous in his <em>Au bal du Moulin de la Galette</em>. Van Gogh treats the motif more as a picturesque, rural element.</p>\n<h4>Urge to innovate</h4>\n<p>The dark palette is still reminiscent of Van Gogh’s Dutch period. But the broad brushstrokes and fluently painted buildings and figures demonstrate an urge to innovate inspired by impressionism. The contrast between the grey-white sky and the red and ochre brown tones in the lower half appears to stem directly from Van Gogh’s experiments with complementary colours.</p>\n                ",

Although he applies the stippling technique in his own distinctive manner. The tables and chairs are not rendered in dots, but in long brushstrokes. Moreover, he uses gradations of colour to suggest shadows, a practice from realism that is not consistent with pointillism.</p>\n<h4>Carefully</h4>\n<p>Exuberant bouquets adorn the tables laid with white tablecloths, like floral still lifes. High in the corner, a black hat ‘floats’ as a reference to a Parisian, who is about to take a seat at the table. The contrasts between the complementary colours – red and green for the walls, yellow and (grey) purple for the floor, and the yellow-orange of the furniture – with the blue in the tablecloths have been carefully applied.</p>\n<h4>Homage</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh may well have intended the work as a kind of homage to modern art. The poster or ‘crepon’ on the wall on the right indicates his interest in Japanese printmaking. The painting in the middle is his own, also pointillist work <em>Lane in Voyer d'Argenson Park at Asnières</em>. It is possible that he is alluding to the role that he himself hopes to play in the development of the new art.</p>\n                ",

In a letter to Theo he describes him as ‘a man who is not bitter, not melancholy, not perfect, not happy and also not always perfectly honest. But such a good fellow, so wise, so feeling and so faithful’.</p>\n<h4>Six portraits&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Between August 1888 and April 1889 he painted six consecutive portraits of Joseph, three of which had flowers in the background. In this colourful painting he chose summer flowers. The poppies, cornflowers, daisies and roses are painted fairly precisely, in contrast to Joseph’s face and full beard with the stylized curls. Here, Van Gogh has applied the paint with a quick, fluent brushstroke.</p>\n<h4>The Roulin family</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh was always looking for models. When the opportunity arose to also paint Joseph’s wife and three children, he grabbed it with both hands.

The picturesque rural setting is full of colour and he believes that his stay in the South will allow him to see it with fresh eyes.</p>\n<h4>Different brushstrokes</h4>\n<p>In <em>Blossoming chestnut trees</em>, Van Gogh experiments with brushstrokes. He applies the green of the trees with flat strokes, while giving structure to the foliage with short, straight, dark blue brushstrokes. On some of the white tapers, he places thick dark blue contours, which enclose the blossom like a kind of gabled roof.</p>\n<h4>Unpainted</h4>\n<p>He paints the sky with overlapping zigzag strokes, a soft version of the sharp stripes in the tree.

He finds his inspiration close to home, in the Place Lamartine municipal park opposite the Yellow House.</p>\n<h4>Intimacy</h4>\n<p>The municipal park is located near ‘the street of the good little ladies’. Due to its proximity to the brothels, Van Gogh believes the park ‘for reason of chastity or morality, empty of flowering shrubs such as the oleander. It’s ordinary plane trees, pines in tall clumps, a weeping tree and green grass. But it has such intimacy!’</p>\n<h4>Sunny</h4>\n<p>That intimacy is reflected in this sunny work. Van Gogh depicts the grass and trees in various shades of green, yellow and orange, with some dark touches added to the canopy here and there to provide extra structure. He himself is also in a sunny mood: ‘I’m beginning to feel quite different from what I was when I came here, I have no more doubts, I no longer hesitate to tackle something, and that could increase still further’.</p>\n                ",

Little figures of ladies with red sunshades, little figures of grape-pickers with their cart further liven it up’.</p>\n<h4>Blood and tears</h4>\n<p>He paints <em>The green vineyard</em> in a single day in a vineyard near Montmajour, not far from Arles. Nature has been ‘exceptionally beautiful’ for a while and he wants to waste no time capturing it. His ‘study of the vineyards’ costs him a great deal of effort, as he later tells Theo: ‘I sweated blood and tears over it – but I have it’.</p>\n<h4>Unprecedented vitality</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh depicts the female figures and grape pickers in quick, varied brushstrokes under a bright blue sky with the lilac silhouette of Arles and orange roofs of the farms on the horizon.

Satisfied, he tells Theo that he created the work in a single session.</p>\n<h4>Comforting motif</h4>\n<p>Wheat fields are a comforting motif for Van Gogh: ‘Their story is ours, for we who live on bread, are we not ourselves wheat to a considerable extent, at least ought we not to submit to growing, powerless to move, like a plant, relative to what our imagination sometimes desires, and to be reaped when we are ripe’.</p>\n                ",

They earn a small fee and have plenty of time to sit for him in various poses: standing, sitting, leaning, drinking coffee or smoking a pipe.</p>\n<h4>Forceful lines and highlights</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh is pleased with these models, whose expressions are full of character due to the hard lives they have behind them. Their actions, poses and characteristic features are sharply rendered in forceful pencil lines and highlighting, which capture the volume of the figures particularly well.</p>\n<h4>Looking for employment</h4>\n<p>He practices so diligently because he hopes to earn his living as an illustrator. In a letter to his brother Theo he writes: ‘If for my part I fill my portfolios with studies from the models that I can grab or catch, I’ll get something to show so that I’ll be eligible, I hope, to be given employment’.</p>\n                ",

Until that time he had made only drawings. He writes to his brother Theo: ‘Well, Mauve immediately installed me in front of a still life consisting of a couple of old clogs and other objects, and so I could set to work’.</p>\n<h4>First painting</h4>\n<p><em>Still life with clogs</em> is Van Gogh’s first painting. The composition is simple: the pair of clogs on the wooden table are half obscured by an earthenware pot. The green bottle on the left still contains a little liquid. On the table top, Van Gogh has scratched lines into the paint with a blunt object – probably the end of his brush – to indicate the edges of the planks.</p>\n<h4>Artistic career</h4>\n<p>Mauve is surprised by this first result: ‘I always thought you were a bloody bore, but now I see that this isn’t so’. This remark from his teacher gives Van Gogh ‘more satisfaction than a whole cartload of Jesuitical compliments would give me’. With painting, he believes that his artistic career has finally begun: ‘Because, Theo, my actual career begins with painting, don’t you think it’s all right to see it that way?’</p>\n                ",

The woman dressed in blue sweeps the floor of her home accompanied by her shadow.</p>\n<h4>Painterly challenge</h4>\n<p>Working in dim lamplight is a painterly challenge. It is sometimes so dark in the cottage that Van Gogh can barely distinguish the colours on his palette. Which colours produce the right effect? How do the light-dark contrasts remain in balance? Unsurprisingly, he finds painting ‘darkness that is still colour’ extremely difficult.</p>\n<h4>Women of the people</h4>\n<p>When choosing his models, Van Gogh prefers women of the people. In regard to more elegant women, he doesn’t think he has much chance of ‘getting on a sufficiently intimate footing with girls of that sort that they’re willing to pose’, but he is ‘possibly also prejudiced against women who wear dresses. And my province is more those who wear jackets and skirts’.</p>\n                ",

He creates a group of seven still lifes with pottery and bottles.</p>\n<h4>Modelling with colours</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh has long been fascinated by the colour theories of Charles Blanc, particularly those regarding complementary colours: colours that reinforce each other. In <em>Still life with jars</em> he experiments with colour contrasts to give the four stoneware jars, the bottle and the white bowl their specific character. But because he uses a tonal palette, the result is still rather dark.</p>\n<h4>Progress</h4>\n<p>The loose, sometimes fairly impasto use of paint shows that Van Gogh’s painting technique has improved and that he has more self-confidence.

He relishes the leaves changing colour and falling, the stormy skies and the melancholy of the twilight. ‘How beautiful it is outside – I sometimes yearn for a country where it would always be autumn.’</p>\n<h4>Central perspective</h4>\n<p>The division of the surface in this autumnal painting is based on the central perspective, which is heavily emphasized by the poplar-lined road. The vanishing point coincides with the setting sun. The female figure stands out darkly against the light of the bright orange setting sun. This ‘silhouette’ signifies that one day the sun will set permanently for everyone.</p>\n                ",

Van Gogh enhances the colour contrasts and uses a wide range of brushstrokes.</p>\n<h4>Colour contrasts</h4>\n<p>On a table top, painted in bold yellowish green brushstrokes, the shining light blue vase contains white daisies, yellow sunflowers, blue lilacs, bright red anemones and dark red lilies(?). The vase and flowers stand out against a blue pointillist background that transitions into a combination of grey and purple towards the bottom.</p>\n<h4>Unaffected</h4>\n<p>The composition is simple and traditional. But the beautiful colours of the bouquet and the variety of brushstrokes attest to an increasing technical ability and self-confidence.

Van Gogh rented a room from him for a few months before moving into the nearby Yellow House.</p>\n<h4>Self-confident man</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh’s depiction of Ginoux is striking. The half-closed eyes and sharp lines of his face show a self-confident man. This is further reinforced by his (Sunday) clothing, the gracefully knotted white tie and the somewhat arrogant way in which he looks down on the painter. The background is painted like a halo around his head.</p>\n<h4>Gaslight</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh probably painted his former landlord in the evening by gaslight. At that time, Paul Gauguin is staying with him in the Yellow House and he had gas installed in the studio before his arrival, so that they could also work in the evenings.

This is apparent, for example, from the harsh tonal difference between the yellow of the lemons and that of the table.</p>\n<h4>Other colours</h4>\n<p>He also adds other colours: the dark green of the bottle, the light green of the background, the orange of the oranges and the cork on the bottle, and above all the light blue shadows. With these, he increases the contrast between the dark lemons and the light yellow of the basket and the table, while at the same time emphasizing the separation between the table edge and the background.</p>\n<h4>Respect</h4>\n<p>Helene Kröller-Müller writes with admiration that 'if you can place yourself in the mind of someone who was able to see lemons and interpret them for us in such a way, then you will enjoy art because from it you feel that, despite everything, there is something in the world that we are always seeking and for which we should always have respect'.</p>\n                ",

He writes to his sister Willemien that he is working on a canvas with ‘tall, ravaged pines against a red sunset sky’.</p>\n<h4>Green tone</h4>\n<p>But while writing to her, all kinds of undefinable thoughts occur to him. ‘Upon looking at my canvas I told myself, that’s not it’. He decides to rework the sky with a green tone: ‘from a distance it softens the tones by breaking them up’. In the painting it is clear that these light green stripes invigorate the sky.</p>\n<h4>Broken tones</h4>\n<p>The green is a colour that ‘appears as matt, dirty white on the palette’. It reminds Van Gogh of his illness. ‘Some of my paintings, when I compare them to others, certainly do bear the trace that it’s a sick man who paints them, and I can assure you that I don’t do it deliberately. But despite myself, my calculations end up at broken tones’.</p>\n                ",

Because no horizon is visible and the three trees in the centre are directly in the foreground, an unusual perspective is created, which is reminiscent of Japanese prints. Incidentally, the trees were originally purple, but have turned blue due to discolouration of the red pigment in the paint.</p>\n<h4>Caricatural lines</h4>\n<p>The two figures on the left, ‘an old fellow and a fat woman, round as a ball’, are depicted with a few well-chosen, almost caricatural lines; a technique that Van Gogh admires in Japanese printmaking.

In this landscape, he uses intense colour contrasts to underscore the impressive richness of nature.</p>\n<h4>Bright colours</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh paints <em>Pollard willows at sunset</em> in March, just as the new leaves are sprouting on the trees. He uses bright yellow, orange, red and blue colours and applies them with a confident touch of alternately longer and shorter erratic brushstrokes.

They are the owners of the night café with whom he has remained in contact. Madame Ginoux is not in a good mental condition. Two days later, Van Gogh himself has another nervous breakdown. While recuperating, he paints a series of portraits of Madame Ginoux, after a drawing of her by Gauguin, including this <em>L’Arlésienne</em>.</p>\n<h4>Synthesis</h4>\n<p>In this work, Van Gogh is looking for ‘an expression different from that of Parisian women’. By this, he is probably referring to the contrast between what he regards as the contrived, unhealthy city life and the unspoilt, healthy countryside. With this portrait he seeks to present a synthesis of simple shapes and colours, as a summation of his earlier collaboration with Gauguin.</p>\n<h4>Balanced</h4>\n<p>Gauguin is very positive about the painting: ‘Very fine and very curious, I like it better than my drawing’. The Ginoux family never saw Van Gogh again. Mrs Ginoux’s health later improved.

The sniffing of the wind when a digger looks up, say, or speaking. Life, in short.’</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n                ",

In the seventeen months prior to that, Van Gogh documents the tower in paintings, drawings and watercolours; 35 works in total. This work is one of the first painted versions. The demolition has yet to begin, the spire is still in place.</p>\n<h4>Walled cemetery</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh paints the tower under a heavily clouded sky. For the sky he harks back to traditional landscape painting, particularly to the work of Jacob van Ruisdael, John Constable and Charles Daubigny. Less prominent but a poignant presence nonetheless is the walled cemetery, where the dark wooden crosses protrude above the wall.</p>\n<h4>Special meaning</h4>\n<p>For Van Gogh, the tower and cemetery are more than a picturesque motif: ‘I wanted to say how this ruin shows that <em>for centuries</em> the peasants have been laid to rest there in the very fields that they grubbed up in life (…) how, though, the life and death of the peasants is and will always be the same, springing up and withering regularly like the grass and the flowers that grow there in that churchyard’.</p>\n                ",

The underdrawing is still visible in several places. For this still life he used painting paper with a light-coloured, rolled ground layer, which results in a grainy structure. The paint is applied sparingly; only in the highlights and in the light colours is a little more paint used.</p>\n<h4>Beginning of the beginning</h4>\n<p><em>Still life with straw hat</em> is Van Gogh’s second painting. Of course it is not yet a ‘masterpiece’, he writes to his brother Theo, ‘and yet I truly believe there’s something sound and real in them (…). And so I now consider myself to be at the beginning of the beginning of making something serious. And because I now have a few more technical resources at my disposal, namely paint and brush, all things are made new again, as it were’.</p>\n                ",

The toil of people digging reminded the French painter of Genesis 3:19: ‘In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground…’ Van Gogh also has this connotation with diggers.</p>\n<h4>Figures in action</h4>\n<p>In <em>Peasant women digging up potatoes</em> he does his best to depict the women in action: ‘Rather than saying there has to be character in a digger – I describe it by saying […] this digger has to dig’. That is why he shows the women bending over: ‘<em>being in the process of working</em> is perhaps something that a <em>lot</em> of vertical lines in the composition would make harder to express’.</p>\n<h4>Peasant clothing</h4>\n<p>The peasant women wear blue smocks. Van Gogh finds the simple, mostly blue peasant clothing ‘very beautiful’; this has ‘struck me here from the first’, he writes to Theo.

One can only speculate about the meaning of the three motifs in the enigmatic <em>Still life with plaster statuette</em>, but it is possible that the painting is a farewell salute to the city and to Theo.</p>\n<h4>Statuette and rose</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh had already drawn and painted the plaster statuette of a Venus torso several times in his painting classes with the historical painter Ferdinand Cormon in 1886. It may refer to the beginning of his stay in Paris. The rose (with its thorns) could be interpreted as Van Gogh’s wish for a happy love life for Theo, who had proposed to Jo Bonger earlier in 1887.</p>\n<h4>Novels</h4>\n<p>The books depicted are Edmond and Jules de Goncourt’s <em>Germinie Lacerteux</em>, about the tragic double life of a housemaid, and Guy de Maupassant’s <em>Bel-Ami</em>, about an opportunist who manages to rise to power using his charms.

The flowers are painted life-sized and fill the entire canvas.</p>\n<h4>Colour studies</h4>\n<p>In Paris, Van Gogh frequently paints flower still lifes to practice his use of colour. In 1886, he writes to a friend: ‘I have made a series of colour studies in painting simply flowers (…) seeking oppositions of blue with orange, red and green, yellow and violet, seeking the broken and neutral tones to harmonise brutal extremes. Trying to render intense colour and not a grey harmony’.</p>\n<h4>Highpoint</h4>\n<p>In this painting, he finds what he sought: warm and cold colours in contrasting tones. The combination of these with the swirling brushstrokes in all directions, but also the strange, undefinable space in which the sunflowers are placed, make this painting one of the highpoints of his Parisian period.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n                ",

In Arles he is Vincent’s painting and drinking companion.

With some self-irony he confesses to Theo: ‘Milliet’s lucky, he has all the Arlésiennes he wants, but there you are, he can’t paint them, and if he was a painter he wouldn’t have any.’ In this portrait he depicts him as the prototype of a lover.</p>\n<h4>Contrasts</h4>\n<p>The face is made up of loose, thin brushstrokes, while the background is applied with broad, thick strokes. The hat, then again, is painted thinly and evenly. The colours are also contrasting.

But before the canvas arrives, he starts work on this painting. He uses a tablecloth in which a dense pattern of small red blocks is woven. This pattern remains visible in unpainted areas on the canvas.</p>\n<h4>Contours</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh first uses a brown-purple colour to apply the contours of the mountains and the farm, and the main lines of the fields. He then fills in the scene with flat and impasto brushstrokes, with green tones for the foreground, ochres for the foliage and farm, and above that, blue-purple mountains and a green-yellow sky. With a layered structure and a varied brushstroke, he manages to create a convincing depth in the mountain scene.</p>\n<h4>Farmhouse</h4>\n<p>The farmhouse is the Mas de Saint-Paul. This 17th century farmhouse is one of the oldest in the area and still exists today. The angular extension on the roof is a dovecote, which indicates that the original occupant must have been a person of stature.

        "intro": "\n                    <p>Following another serious breakdown, Van Gogh copies an engraving of <em>The Good Samaritan</em> by Delacroix. Copying does not mean that he slavishly imitates the revered master. He works from a black and white reproduction of the work and makes his own translation in colour and on canvas, based on his memories of the painting.</p>\n<h4>Interpretation</h4>\n<p>Delacroix is Van Gogh’s spiritual mentor in colour, which is apparent in the contrasts of blue/violet-yellow and red-green. He works with heavy lines and wavy brushwork. ‘The vague consonance of colours that are in the same sentiment, if not right – that’s my own interpretation.’</p>\n<h4>Allusion</h4>\n<p>It does not seem coincidental that Van Gogh chooses Delacroix’s <em>Samaritan</em>, the compassionate man who interrupts his journey to help a defenceless man who has been robbed. Van Gogh also has to recover. And with this painting, perhaps he also alludes to his brother Theo, his own good Samaritan who is always there for him.</p>\n                ",

        "intro": "\n                    <h4>Symbol of Provence</h4>\n<p>For Van Gogh, the cypress is the ultimate symbol of Provence. ‘The cypresses still preoccupy me’, he writes to his brother Theo, ‘I’d like to do something with them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that no one has yet done them as I see them. It’s beautiful as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk. And the green has such a distinguished quality’.</p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh paints<em> Country road in Provence by night</em> shortly before leaving the asylum at Saint-Rémy. This is not an existing landscape, but instead composed at his own discretion, presumably as a final reminder of Saint-Rémy and as a summary of the many impressions he acquired during his stay in Provence.</p>\n<h4>Swirling lines</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh experiments with his use of colour and brushwork in Saint-Rémy. Many works are composed of graceful forms and swirling lines. That is also the case here. The short, rhythmic wavy brushstrokes placed side by side give the painting great dynamism.</p>\n<p><a class=\"c-button c-button--arrow\" href=\"http://mapmyvisit.com/object/viewobject/1187/en/E3AF2786F3E6D13E97889B61815A3E4B\">Listen to background story in the Podcatcher audio tour</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>This work is part of the <a href=\"/admin/zicht/kmmwebsite/page-collectionitempage/7838/This%20work is part of the Canon of the Netherlands\">Canon of the Netherlands</a>.<br><img class=\"img-full\" src=\"/media/nieuws_en_blog/canon_def.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"757\" height=\"140\"></p>\n                ",

While waiting for that to arrive, he spends his time drawing studies of trees.</p>\n<h4>Composition and autumnal colours</h4>\n<p>When he receives the delivery of paint in early November, he decides to depict the characteristic large pine trees in the garden in colour too. This painting seems primarily intended as an exercise in composition and autumnal colours. The towering, abruptly cropped trees provide a vertical contrast against the undulating path, painted with diagonal brushstrokes.</p>\n<h4>Figure</h4>\n<p>The figure in blue in the centre of the picture, sitting on a low wall, attracts the attention. It almost seems to pose for the painter, leaning calmly against one of the tree trunks. In the background, what is presumably the wall of the men’s dormitory at the asylum is depicted with vertical brushstrokes in sand-coloured paint.</p>\n                ",

With the help of various textbooks he concentrates on drawing, which he regards as the basis of everything.</p>\n<h4>Further development</h4>\n<p>After a fierce disagreement with his father, in late 1881 Van Gogh leaves for The Hague, where he hopes to further develop his skills as an artist. He makes his first paintings there, but mainly practices drawing cityscapes, people in the streets, old men and women, and Sien, who lives with him at that time.</p>\n<h4>Strong contrast</h4>\n<p>In this drawing, Sien sits on the floor of the studio near the stove. She smokes a cigar and appears lost in thought. Her white undergarments form a strong contrast with the darker floor and wall of the studio, which Van Gogh renders sketchily in hard strokes with his black carpenter’s pencil.</p>\n                ",

In this study he is clearly still struggling with composition. The man looks obliquely to the right: his eyes are at different heights.

This creates a cast shadow that reinforces the depth effect. The basket contains large cooking apples and pumpkins, with smaller apples in front of and beside the basket and ornamental pumpkins bathed in light on the left. The wickerwork of the basket is ‘woven again with the brush’ as it were.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Impasto</h4>\n<p>The ‘warty’ pumpkins and the ruddy apples are also rendered eloquently.

When his illness permits, he works. He finds the motifs in the immediate surroundings: the enclosed wheatfield that he sees from his window, the garden of the asylum, the olive groves, the cypresses and the surrounding hilly landscape.</p>\n<h4>View</h4>\n<p>This painting shows the view from his room on the first floor. The wheat is still partly green and poppies and daisies are growing in the front of the field. Van Gogh is delighted with this view: ‘But what a beautiful land and what beautiful blue and what a sun. And yet I’ve only seen the garden and what I can make out through the window’.</p>\n<h4>Depiction of depth</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh has clearly struggled with the depiction of depth in the wheatfield: at the bottom, the view is almost directly facing the wheat and the flowers, while the middle of the field appears to be painted from a higher vantage point. The wall behind runs steeply diagonal to the right, which gives the total image a strong dynamic.</p>\n                ",

Van Gogh writes that ‘nothing is observed’ in these works and they have ‘driven me mad’. According to him, you can convey deeply felt sentiments just as well with an everyday motif, depicted in carefully chosen colours.</p>\n<h4>Laid down loosely</h4>\n<p><em>Olive grove with two olive pickers</em> is created when he goes ‘messing about’ in the orchards again on ‘bright and cold days, but in very beautiful, clear sunshine’. The work, with its orange-yellow and green sky, is laid down rather loosely. The red underpainting remains visible in the contours of the trees and the figure in the foreground. In a later session, Van Gogh covers some of the red clouds with greenish-yellow brushstrokes.</p>\n                ",

One of these is Still life with a plate of onions, painted in contrasting colours. The drawing board consists of almost horizontal brushstrokes, while the background is composed of vertical brushstrokes.</p>\n<h4>Objects</h4>\n<p>The objects indicate that Van Gogh has picked up the routine of everyday life again: the letter from Theo, the plate of onions, the pipe with tobacco, the bottle of wine or absinth, the pot of coffee, the calendar with the burning candle, the stick of sealing wax, the box of matches and finally, the book Annuaire de la santé about good nutrition and hygiene.</p>\n<p><br>This work is part of the <a href=\"/admin/zicht/kmmwebsite/page-collectionitempage/7838/This%20work is part of the Canon of the Netherlands\">Canon of the Netherlands</a>.<br><img class=\"img-full\" src=\"/media/nieuws_en_blog/canon_def.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"757\" height=\"140\"></p>\n                ",

But research that compared the threads and weave of the canvas with other works has revealed that Van Gogh made this painting in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. The dating has therefore also been changed from July 1890 to October 1889.</p>\n<h4>Unusual angle</h4>\n<p>The wheat stack is located in the walled field of the asylum into which Van Gogh had himself admitted. It appears in several paintings from his time in Saint-Rémy, as he can see it from his bedroom window. But here he chooses an unusual angle, which is why the field was not recognized previously. Van Gogh walked into the field and turned 90 degrees. The wall around the field is just visible on the right, but the characteristic erratic shapes of the Alpilles that appear above the wall in other paintings are not visible here.</p>\n<h4>Stormy day</h4>\n<p>It appears that W<em>heat stack under a cloudy sky</em> was made after a heavy downpour. The crows that fly through the centre of the image are reflected in the large puddle in the foreground. The predominantly diagonal brushstrokes give the scene an inclination to the left and suggest that the wind was coming from the right on this stormy day.</p>\n                ",

He does, however, add that there is ‘nothing sad’ in this death. That is why he depicts the landscape ‘in broad daylight with a sun that floods everything with a light of fine gold’.</p>\n<h4>Gauguin</h4>\n<p>The reaper is rendered with only a few touches of blue in the wet yellow paint, whereby the outlines have become greenish. The single brushstroke of the sickle is barely visible. The painting is shown in the exhibition of the <em>Indépendants</em> in Paris in March 1890.

One of these is <em>At Eternity’s Gate</em>, after a drawing he made in The Hague in 1882, for which he had used a motif from Etten.</p>\n<h4>Continue learning</h4>\n<p>During periods of depression, Van Gogh often feels the urge to rework a drawing or painting. Then he begins to think that he still cannot do enough and that he must continue learning. But he is also curious about how his copy of this work from Brabant will turn out now that he has developed a completely different style.</p>\n<h4>Modified composition</h4>\n<p><em>Sorrowing old man (‘At Eternity’s Gate’)</em> is therefore not a literal copy in colour.

His role as a teacher encourages Van Gogh to take up still life painting again himself and he paints enthusiastically with his students. The tobacco pot and bearded-man jar shown here are probably from Hermans’ collection.</p>\n<h4>Tubes of paint</h4>\n<p>Initially, Van Gogh receives nothing for his work as a teacher, but he intends to ‘gradually get people to pay something – not in money, however, but by telling them you must give me tubes of paint. Because I want to paint a lot – continually, and I want to get to a position where I no longer have to work at half speed – but can paint from morning till night’.</p>\n                ",

For the first month he is not allowed to leave the grounds, but within the walls is an overgrown garden with pine trees, which proves to be a great source of inspiration for new studies and motifs.</p>\n<h4>Unusual viewpoint</h4>\n<p>For <em>The garden of the asylum at Saint-Rémy</em>, Van Gogh chooses an unusual viewpoint, next to the wall of the hospital. Due to the diagonal path with a stone bench, the painting acquires a particularly spatial effect. The exuberantly flowering bushes and trees are depicted in a tangle of thickly painted brushstrokes. Despite the huge variety of shapes and colours, the composition has both depth and structure.</p>\n<h4>The meaning of colours</h4>\n<p>In September of the previous year, Van Gogh writes from Arles to his sister Wil about what the colours mean to him: ‘We need good cheer and happiness, hope and love. The uglier, older, meaner, iller, poorer I get, the more I wish to take my revenge by doing brilliant colour, well arranged, resplendent’.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n                ",

Walt Whitman and Thomas Carlyle, authors that he admires, describe the starry night as ‘a manifestation of eternity’ and ‘the open secret of the mystery of the universe’. Van Gogh wants to introduce a personal sentiment into the painting.</p>\n<h4>Nocturnal light effect</h4>\n<p>The moon is just rising over the Alpilles, illuminating the wheat sheaves in the foreground. Van Gogh spends a long time working on the canvas. In the final phase, he paints a maze of small, light purple brushstrokes over the scene to enhance the nocturnal light effect. Over time, these have gradually discoloured to much whiter stripes, making the scene less ‘nocturnal’ than he had intended.</p>\n<h4>Too far-fetched</h4>\n<p>Van Gogh paints this landscape largely in his studio. He believes that painting from reality is the most important, but Gauguin encouraged him to work from imagination and memory during their brief collaboration. He is ultimately not very satisfied with the result. He finds the composition exaggerated and the style too far-fetched: it lacks ‘deeply felt lines’.</p>\n                ",

In it, his love for nature, his outlook on life, his idiosyncratic choices and his improving, largely self-taught craftsmanship all come together.</p>\n<h4>Throughout life</h4>\n<p>For Van Gogh, nature is not just the expansive, uncultivated landscape. Throughout his life he would continue to be fascinated by crops, such as wheat and fruit trees, and by the small growth and flourishing of low vegetation, such as grass, ivy and the tree trunks. He makes <em>Tree roots in a sandy ground</em> in The Hague, but would revisit the theme in France.</p>\n                ",

And not one in the conventional manner, in shades of black and grey, but actually with an abundance of colours. Equally unconventional is that he paints this gas-lit terrace of a café in Arles in situ and in the dark, because colours have a different appearance during the day than by night.</p>\n<h4>Sharp contrast</h4>\n<p>The most eye-catching aspect is the sharp contrast between the warm yellow, green and orange colours under the marquise and the deep blue of the starry sky, which is reinforced by the dark blue of the houses in the background. Van Gogh was pleased with the effect: ‘I believe that an abundance of gaslight, which, after all, is yellow and orange, intensifies blue.’</p>\n<h4>Constellations</h4>\n<p>He writes to his sister Wil: ‘I enormously enjoy painting on the spot at night.’ The fact that he observes keenly is borne out by later astronomical research. He painted the constellations precisely as they appeared on the night of 16 or 17 September 1888.</p>\n<p><a class=\"c-button c-button--arrow\" href=\"https://tickets.krollermuller.nl/en/tickets\">Plan your visit</a></p>\n<p><br>This work is part of the <a href=\"/admin/zicht/kmmwebsite/page-collectionitempage/7838/This%20work is part of the Canon of the Netherlands\">Canon of the Netherlands</a>.<br><img class=\"img-full\" src=\"/media/nieuws_en_blog/canon_def.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"757\" height=\"140\"></p>\n                ",
