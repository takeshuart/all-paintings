        "intro": "Van Gogh saw the <em>Potato Eaters</em> as a showpiece, for which he deliberately chose a difficult composition to prove he was on his way to becoming a good figure painter. The painting had to depict the harsh reality of country life, so he gave the peasants coarse faces and bony, working hands. <a href=\"http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let497/letter.html\">He wanted</a> to show in this way that they ‘have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish ... that they have thus honestly earned their food’. <br><br> He painted the five figures in earth colours – ‘something like the colour of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course’. The message of the painting was more important to Van Gogh than correct anatomy or technical perfection. He was very pleased with the result: yet his painting drew considerable criticism because its colours were so dark and the figures full of mistakes. Nowadays, the Potato Eaters is one of Van Gogh’s most famous works.",

They built up their compositions from dots of paint. Van Gogh instead applied small brushstrokes of varying length in different directions. This helped him to create the effect of a radiant spring day, which fit the sense of intimacy and togetherness he wished to express. He too longed for a wife and a family, but he had 'the most impossible love affairs'. He eventually resigned himself to the situation; he was devoted to his art.",

In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence.<br><br>The sunflower paintings had a special significance for Van Gogh: they communicated ‘gratitude’, <a href=\"http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let740/letter.html\">he wrote</a>. He hung the first two in the room of his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin, who came to live with him for a while in the Yellow House. Gauguin was impressed by the sunflowers, which he thought were ‘completely Vincent’. Van Gogh had already painted a new version during his friend’s stay and Gauguin later asked for one as a gift, which Vincent was reluctant to give him. He later produced two loose copies, however, one of which is now in the Van Gogh Museum.",

The walls and doors, for instance, were originally purple rather than blue.\nThe apparently odd angle of the rear wall, meanwhile, is not a mistake on Van Gogh’s part – the corner really was skewed. The rules of perspective seem not to have been accurately applied throughout the painting, but this was a deliberate choice. Vincent told Theo in <a href=\"http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let741/letter.html\">a letter</a> that he had deliberately ‘flattened’ the interior and left out the shadows so that his picture would resemble a Japanese print. Van Gogh was very pleased with the painting: ‘When I saw my canvases again after my illness, what seemed to me the best was the bedroom.’",

Van Gogh drew inspiration for this drawing from the crowded street scenes in Japanese prints. The bright colours of those prints also stimulated his creativity.<br><br>This cityscape is one of the few drawings he made in Paris. He mostly worked in oil paint on canvas during his time there and developed a brighter, more modern colour palette. Colour and brightness also play a central role in this watercolour drawing.",

He was fascinated by the ever-changing colour of the olive trees and tried to find a good way of painting their irregular growth. His solution was to use swirling brushstrokes, bold outlines around the trunks and stylized blue shadows.<br><br>Van Gogh made his paintings of olive groves just after his friends Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard had painted a number of religious scenes. They created those works from their imaginations. Van Gogh disagreed with that approach. He felt that reality should always be the starting point: 'My ambition is truly limited to a few clods of earth, some sprouting wheat. An olive grove,' <a href=\"http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let822/letter.html\">he wrote</a> to Bernard.",

He was particularly interested in working-class people, one of whom was the woman portrayed here. Perhaps she worked in a café and, like many impoverished women, was forced to earn extra money as a prostitute at night.<br><br>While her face evinces the traces of hard work, Van Gogh also wanted to convey her beauty. In these ‘studies of heads’ the artist was not interested in depicting an individual likeness, but rather a type. He painted the woman's face and long, loose hair with broad brushstrokes, thereby successfully introducing volume and life into them. He probably depicted the same woman in another painting as well.",

He later made two larger ones on canvas.<br><br>Because Van Gogh did not have any canvas at hand, he painted the garden on a red and white striped tea towel. He first covered the towel with a bright pink ground layer of lead-white pigment mixed with red. This pink base formed a vivid contrast with the green paint he used for the garden. The ground layer is visible between the strokes of paint. The red pigment has faded over time, so the pink base now looks grey.",

Van Gogh stayed there in 1889-1890, in a psychiatric hospital in Saint-Rémy (FR). He thought the cypresses were beautiful and compared their shape and proportions to those of an Egyptian obelisk.<br><br>He painted the trees with swirling brushstrokes in various shades of green and black, with an occasional touch of red for contrast. The colour of the trees was challenging – in a letter to his brother, <a href=\"http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let783/letter.html\">Van Gogh called it</a> 'that difficult shade of bottle green'.",

Van Gogh <a href=\"http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let822/letter.html\">wrote</a> to his friend Bernard about this painting: ‘You’ll understand that this combination of red ochre, of green saddened with grey, of black lines that define the outlines, this gives rise a little to the feeling of anxiety from which some of my companions in misfortune often suffer, and which is called “seeing red”.’<br><br>Van Gogh had discovered that he could use colours to express a feeling. He intensified the emotional charge of his works by combining colours to create harmony on the one hand, or contrast on the other.",

The Moulin de la Galette was popular among artists. They went there to dance and drink but also liked to paint there.<br><br>Van Gogh lived nearby. He made a number of drawings and paintings on the grounds of the mill. After dark, the narrow street was filled with people out for a good time. But Van Gogh chose a quiet daytime moment for his drawing. Could it have been a mistake that the Dutch flag is flying in his painting instead of the French one?",

He had done that deliberately, so that he could later use the drawing as the basis for a painting. But he never carried out that plan.",

For this view of La Crau, for instance, he drew on the hatched prints and drawings of the Japanese. He used a wide variety of strokes, dots and crosses to emphasize the flatness of the landscape. <a href=\"http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let641/letter.html\">He wrote</a> to his friend, the artist Émile Bernard, 'It does NOT look Japanese, and it's actually the most Japanese thing that I've done.'",

Fellow-artists had told him about the beauty of the landscape. And although he sometimes felt that the heathland was ‘as irritatingly tedious and fatiguing as the desert’ in the clear light of day, in the low evening light he found it ‘sublime’.",
